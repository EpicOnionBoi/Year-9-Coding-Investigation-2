# Year-9-Coding-Investigation-2
Can do the following:
- Find the number of names, longest, and shortest names in the names.txt file
- Split a name into its letter pairs
- Display the request number of the most frequently occurring pairs
- Display letter pairs starting with a specified character
- Flip a coin with 0.8 probability of tails (0), and 0.2 probability of heads (1). Also does this a thousand times for experimental probability
- Spin a spinner with scores 0, 1, 2, 3 with the probabilities of 0.2, 0.1, 0.1, and 0.6 respectively. Also does this a thousand times for experimental probability
- Output a random letter pair with probabilities weighted the same as the frequency it occurs
- Generates a requested number of names with and without a specified first letter, picks the next letter based on a random choice with weighted probability
- Generates a requested number of names with all letters having equal probability of occurring
- Splits an inputted name into pairs and then evaluates the probability of each pair occurring in the pairs file
